ENTITY DRAG: SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

- user drags mouse on entity box

- jQuery updates x,y location, or width/height, of entity DIV, matching the
  amount of drag

- AngularJS updates an Entity Model object to have matching x, y, width, height
  values to the DIV

- Entity Controller watches the Entity Model -- when the model changes, the
  controller "Emits" an event "entityChange"

- GraphController receives EntityChange event and "broadcasts" a
  relocateIfAttachedToEntity event

- Endpoints receive the relocateIfAttachedToEntity event, and relocate
  (possibly change sides) and negotiate coordinates

- To relocate, each endpoint asks its entity which side is closest to its
  "other" entity, and tells the entity to "addEndpoint"

- To negotiate coordinates, each endpoint asks its entity what other endpoints
  are its siblings. It asks each sibling to calculate its ideals. It sorts the
  list of siblings is by amount of offset/angle. It assigns its siblings the
  nearest coordinates within remaining allowed bounds to their ideals, in
  priority order.

- To calculate ideals, the endpoint asks its entity (and its "other" entity)
  for various information including center coordinates, width/height, outward
  distance, etc.
