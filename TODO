Remove index
BUG fix: Firefox SVG paths are invisible

BUG: resize corner graphic
BUG fix: Relationships vanish below a certain y-coordinate.
Ability to snapshot a graph. Snapshot has a unique URL that does NOT include the source (editable) graph.
Persona authentication
Remove index view
Multiple relationships between 2 entities always cross each other
Pan: click and drag the canvas in select mode
New loads an editor WITHOUT a Graph ID; URL is updated when graph is first saved. (Reduce the number of blank graphs).
Rename begins immediately on entity creation
Enter finishes renaming entity
draw new entity "ghost" connected to mouse
Arrowheads should "squish" together when there's not enough space
Tab to finish rename and move to edit attributes
Print layout shouldn't show toolbar
Reflexive relationships should float around the entity away from other relationships
Identifier squiggle, toggled by Command-Shift-Click
ctrl-S hotkey for save graph
zoom: turn the mouse wheel (direction configurable?)
add entity and relationship at same time, with preset symbols, based on keystrokes. 'm' adds a has-many relationship from the selected entity. Also '1', and just 'h' (has) which puts down '?' symbols.
place entity by its center instead of corner
new relationship "ghost" connected to mouse
make entity not resizable below minimum sizing


RE-ENGINEERING, MORE

  Arrowhead functionality should be part of the endpoint. Remove graph controller's list of arrowheads.
  Relationship should construct endpoints. Endpoint should not need to know about its relationship.
  Controllers should talk to each other with $emit and $broadcast.
    Entity deletion: graph broadcasts an entityDelete message, and then deletes the entity from its list
      Endpoints referencing the entity receive the entityDelete and emit an endpointDelete message.
        Graph receives endpointDelete message and deletes any associated relationship.
  Entity, side, endpoint, relationship: make all the dependencies go one-way between them, by adding additional classes responsible for connecting them together.

INDICATE SYNTAX ERRORS
  only one end can have an identifier
	both ends should say "be" if either end does
	duplicate entity names are indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)
	duplicate attribute names within an entity are indicated as a syntax error
	entity without identifier is indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)

OFFER LDS EVOLUTION SUGGESTIONS (highlight in yellow, hover text)
	many-to-many suggests adding an intersection entity
	double click suggested intersections to add an intersection (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)
	pick up on plural attributes and highlight as suggestions to promote to entity
	double click suggested promotions to promote (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)

EXAMPLE DATA GENERATION
	example data table appears per entity, bring up by command
		edit example data
		pre-fill example data with auto-faker library

APP GENERATION
	set "scale" (nominal/numeric/categoric) on columns
		scaffold an application with all entities associated. Each entity has a full CRUD interface, plus an "Add ___" button to add many-relationship objects. When adding an object that has parent entities, treat their attributes as attributes of the child being added.
			add button for generating a fake data row (mark as fake)
				add "delete all fake data" button

NICE TO HAVE
  resize entity from top or left

  MULTI-SELECT
    box-select multiple entities and relationship endings together
    delete multi-selected entities and relationship endings together
    move multi-selected entities together (ignore selected relationships which cannot be individually moved)
