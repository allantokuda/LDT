Bugs
  Double click doesn't edit attribute (need to click near border)
  Relationships vanish below a certain y-coordinate.
  Multiple relationships between 2 entities always cross each other

COMPLETE A BARE BONES CRUD UI

    save graph (by keypress) -- create random string identifier
    re-edit graph (setup URL accepting graph ID string)

Backlog:

  Score the endpoints based on the severity of their angles instead of pure offset.  (The closer of 2 entities loses the negotiation sooner than it should.)
  Arrowheads should "squish" together when there's not enough space
  Enter finishes renaming entity
  Rename begins immediately on entity creation
  Tab finishes rename and moves to edit attributes
  Print layout doesn't show toolbar
  Investigate: layoutGraph is getting called twice
  Feature: Make reflexive relationships float around the entity away from other relationships
  Feature: add an identifier squiggle, toggled by Command-Shift-Click


BUILD THE DREAM
	set "scale" (Carlis) on columns with keypresses
		scaffold an application with all entities associated. Each entity has a full crud interface, plus an "Add ___" button to add many-relationship objects. When adding an object that has parent entities, treat their attributes as attributes of the child being added.
			add button for generating a fake data row (mark as fake)
				add "delete all fake data" button

	example data table appears per entity, bring up by command
		edit example data
		pre-fill example data with auto-faker library

SECURITY
  Add password protection for access
  Add password protection for edit

MAKE UI SCALE
	add scroll
	add zoom

MAKE UI FASTER TO USE
	add entity and relationship at same time, with preset symbols, based on keystrokes. 'm' adds a has-many relationship from the selected entity. Also '1', and just 'h' (has) which puts down '?' symbols.

MAKE UI PRESENTABLE
  place entity by its center instead of corner
	draw new entity "ghost" connected to mouse
	draw new relationship "ghost" connected to mouse
  make entity not resizable below minimum sizing

MAKE UI NICER TO USE
	resize entity from top or left

MULTI-SELECT
	box-select multiple entities and relationship endings together
	delete multi-selected entities and relationship endings together
	move multi-selected entities together (ignore selected relationships which cannot be individually moved)

KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS
	auto-select a relationship ending when creating
	set key for switching to opposite ending

COMPLETE LDS FUNCTIONALITY FOR CARLIS
	Add labels
	Add 'b' key for 'be' relationships and ensure they go both ways (and do not accept a label, many endings)
	when setting an identifier, kill the opposite end identifier

INDICATE SYNTAX ERRORS
	duplicate entity names are indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)
	duplicate attribute names within an entity are indicated as a syntax error
	entity without identifier is indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)

OFFER LDS EVOLUTION SUGGESTIONS (highlight in yellow, hover text)
	many-to-many suggests adding an intersection entity
	double click suggested intersections to add an intersection (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)
	pick up on plural attributes and highlight as suggestions to promote to entity
	double click suggested promotions to promote (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)
