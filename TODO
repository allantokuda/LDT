BUGS
  Relationships vanish below a certain y-coordinate.
  Multiple relationships between 2 entities always cross each other
  layoutGraph is getting called twice (investigate)

MUST HAVE FOR FIRST DEMO
  Back button
	Labeled relationship endings
  Persona
  Create random string identifier for graph and make this the path
	draw new entity "ghost" connected to mouse
  Score the endpoints based on the severity of their angles instead of pure offset.  (The closer of 2 entities loses the negotiation sooner than it should.)
  Password protection for access
  Password protection for edit

BACKLOG
  Arrowheads should "squish" together when there's not enough space
	Pan: click and drag the canvas in select mode
  Enter finishes renaming entity
  Rename begins immediately on entity creation
  Tab to finish rename and move to edit attributes
  print layout shouldn't show toolbar
  reflexive relationships should float around the entity away from other relationships
  identifier squiggle, toggled by Command-Shift-Click
  ctrl-S hotkey for save graph
	zoom: turn the mouse wheel (direction configurable?)
	add entity and relationship at same time, with preset symbols, based on keystrokes. 'm' adds a has-many relationship from the selected entity. Also '1', and just 'h' (has) which puts down '?' symbols.
  place entity by its center instead of corner
	new relationship "ghost" connected to mouse
  make entity not resizable below minimum sizing

INDICATE SYNTAX ERRORS
  only one end can have an identifier
	both ends should say "be" if either end does
	duplicate entity names are indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)
	duplicate attribute names within an entity are indicated as a syntax error
	entity without identifier is indicated as a syntax error (highlight in red, hover text)

OFFER LDS EVOLUTION SUGGESTIONS (highlight in yellow, hover text)
	many-to-many suggests adding an intersection entity
	double click suggested intersections to add an intersection (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)
	pick up on plural attributes and highlight as suggestions to promote to entity
	double click suggested promotions to promote (new entity attached to mouse, drop to place)

EXAMPLE DATA GENERATION
	example data table appears per entity, bring up by command
		edit example data
		pre-fill example data with auto-faker library

APP GENERATION
	set "scale" (nominal/numeric/categoric) on columns
		scaffold an application with all entities associated. Each entity has a full CRUD interface, plus an "Add ___" button to add many-relationship objects. When adding an object that has parent entities, treat their attributes as attributes of the child being added.
			add button for generating a fake data row (mark as fake)
				add "delete all fake data" button

NICE TO HAVE
  resize entity from top or left

  MULTI-SELECT
    box-select multiple entities and relationship endings together
    delete multi-selected entities and relationship endings together
    move multi-selected entities together (ignore selected relationships which cannot be individually moved)
