v0.2 drawRelationship algorithm

PASS 1: requestEndpoints
  for each relationship:
    for each endpoint entity on that relationship:
      assign an "endpoint" to the entity with data:
        relationship ID
        side
        center-to-center offset

PASS 2: positionEndpoints
  for each entity:
    for each side on the entity:
      sort the endpoints by ABSOLUTE VALUE of center-to-center offset (largest first)
      initialize max,min bounds
      for each endpoint, in sort order:
        place in ideal location within the remaining bounds
        reduce remaining bounds accordingly

PASS 3: drawPositionedRelationships
  for each relationship:
    get endpoint from each entity, including assigned location
    draw the relationship
